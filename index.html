            <p>Simple and effective ✔️ How does it work? We explain it to you below, but first read a story 📖</p>
          </div>
          <br><br><br>
          <div>
            <h4 class="text-center">The story</h4>
            <p>Yes, I know ... that card has recently entered the meta and the price has skyrocketed. But you absolutely need it, otherwise no ranked weekend rewards 😔. You can't buy it for very little, but the right opportunity could be around the corner. Ohhh there it is. The price has dropped, your chance has come! 🤩</p>
            <p>But you are playing on Gods Unchained and you can't see the price ... </p>
            <p>But you're watching a series on Netflix and can't see the price ... </p>
            <p>But you're doing everything else, which isn't as important as buying that card, and you can't see the price ... </p>
            <p>Ooops, the price is back up. You have to wait, again. You need to find a solution. <strong>GuAlert</strong>🤖 <strong>can become your solution</strong> 😎</p>

          <div>
            <h4>I'm only a poor mortal, can you explain me how to use GuAlert🤖?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Sure, GuAlert🤖 uses telegram bot technology, so just download the app and add @guAlertBot. After that, follow these simple steps to start interacting with the bot:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Add a card for which you want to receive an update of its market price. It doesn't matter if you don't remember its full name, GuAlert🤖 will try to help you based on what you submitted.</li>
              <li>Select the card quality: Meteorite, Shadow, Gold and Diamond 👈</li>
              <li>It's done! From now on you will receive a message every time the price of the card on the market changes (both increasing and decreasing). GuAlert🤖 always tracks the lowest price on the market 🤑 (...for now only cards listed in ETH)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can track up to three cards at the same time 🔒</p>
            <p>Remember, you can always get the list of the cards you are following and decide whether to delete one of them to stop receiving notifications from GuAlert🤖</p>
          </div>
          <br><br><br>
          <div>
            <h4>Good introduction, can you also give me the list of commands avaiable?</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Yep, the commands list is also avaiable directrly in Telegram but replace another this is also a good idea 🙂</p>
